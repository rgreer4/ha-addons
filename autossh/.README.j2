Autossh add-on by DSR! for Home Assistant add-ons.

## About

Use SSH to make ports of your local Home Assistant setup available at or through a remote system.
This forms yet another way to make the Lovelace UI and other services accessible from another network or the public internet.
If you do not have the authority to open ports into your local network, and a VPN solutions seems overkill, this add-on might just be the solution for you.

The solution is only useful to those with access to a publicly available SSH server and some administrative privileges on that system.

Autossh is a well known tool to establish an SSH connection and keep it connected over hours and months.
SSH is known for its high security and the ability to set up port forwardings in both directions through the SSH connection.
In combination, this add-on offers tunneled port forwarding functionality.

The solution works reliably and without disruptions.
